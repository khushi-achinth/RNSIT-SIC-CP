Engineering Branch Analytics - Documentation

Overview
    This program analyzes various engineering branches based on different factors such as entrepreneurship potential, practical exposure, job demand, salary, and dropout rates. 
    It processes a dataset of engineering branches to extract insights that help in decision-making.

Dataset
    Branch Name: Name of the engineering branch.
    Startups in the Field: Indicates the number of startups in that field (e.g., "Many", "Few").
    Emerging Technologies: Lists the technologies associated with the branch.
    Industry Collaboration: Describes industry collaboration as "Strong" or "Weak".
    Current Demand: Job demand categorized as "Very High", "High", "Moderate", etc.
    Practical Exposure: Level of practical exposure in the branch (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low").
    Internships (%): Percentage of students getting internships.
    Average Salary (INR): Average salary offered to graduates of the branch.
    Dropout Rates (%): Percentage of students who drop out from the branch.

Analysis Performed
    1. Finding the Best Branch for Entrepreneurship
        Factors Considered:
            Number of startups in the field
            Emerging technologies
            Industry collaboration

        How It Works:
            A score is assigned based on the number of startups in a field, with a higher score for more startups.
            The number of emerging technologies associated with each branch is counted.
            A score is assigned based on industry collaboration, with strong collaboration receiving a higher score.
            The total entrepreneurship score is calculated by summing up these three factors.
            The branch with the highest entrepreneurship score is selected.

    2. Identifying the Branch with High Job Demand but Low Practical Exposure
        Factors Considered:
            Job demand
            Practical exposure level
            Internship opportunities

        How It Works:
            Job demand levels are mapped to numerical values, with higher demand getting a higher score.
            Practical exposure is also scored based on its level (high, medium, or low).
            The percentage of students obtaining internships is included as an additional factor.
            A total practical exposure score is computed by summing these factors.
            The branch with the lowest practical exposure score despite high demand is selected.

    3. Finding the Branch with High Salaries but High Dropout Rates
        Factors Considered:
            Average salary
            Dropout rate
        
        How It Works:
            A score is calculated by subtracting the dropout rate from the average salary.
            The branches are ranked based on this score.
            The branch with the highest score (indicating high salary but high dropout rate) is selected.

Visualizations
    The program generates visual charts to represent:
        Entrepreneurship Potential Across Branches
        Practical Exposure vs. Job Demand
        Salary vs. Dropout Rate Comparison
    Example Chart for Entrepreneurship Scores:
        A bar chart is created to represent the entrepreneurship scores of different branches.
        The x-axis represents the branch names, while the y-axis represents the entrepreneurship scores.
        The chart is customized for readability, including labels, titles, and rotated axis text.

Inference
    This program provides insights into:
        The best branch for entrepreneurship.
        Branches with high job demand but low practical exposure.
        Branches with high salaries but high dropout rates.
        These insights help students and educators in making informed decisions about career paths in engineering.
